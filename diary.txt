14/10/16	14:00	16:00	Looked at assignment for first time
							Restructured code so that user details are formatted in a certain way and displayed correctly
							Sensitive information is filtered out too

18/10/16	14:45	16:30	Messed around with CSS to personalise site. Just getting comfortable with CSS and figuring out what does what. 
							Lots of googling different parameters. 

19/10/16	22:00	24:00	Added in profile picture display. Messed with CSS some more. 
							Added in background colours and personalised titles and colours. 

20/10/16	10:20	11:00	Added in the feature to show a stock image if no profile picture is available. 

20/10/16	17:00	22:00	Added in posts of users. Need to arrange them in the correct order however.  
							Restructured code entirely so instead of returning things to print the subroutines just printed them out.
							Doing this allowed me to format my page to how I wanted it. Through doing this it allowed me to display posts one after the other. 

21/10/16	10:15	12:45	Added in friends list feature. Currently only displays zIDs of friends. Need to convert it to actual names and pictures.
							Also need to link friends to the actual pages. Have no idea how to do that currently. Will ask around to see how others are tackling it. 

23/10/16	20:00	22:00	Added in skeleton for a login and search feature. 	

24/10/16	15:00	18:00	Added in pictures and names instead of zIDs in the matelist. Also made them all hyperlinks to the specified pages.
							Had to change URL of website so profileID is visible. May be a security flaw or something.

24/10/16	21:00	24:00	Implemented the search feature fully with profile pictures and links to the searched people's pages.

25/10/16 	10:10	12:00	Got login feature working mostly. However whenever the page refreshes it asks to login again and again.
							Need to implement a persistent login through implementing cookies which I have no idea how to do. More research ahead.

25/10/16	15:30	19:00	Restructured code so its more legible 
							(divided login, search, posts, matelists all into separate subfunctions that are called in main rather than altogether)
							Also added in functional retry button into the login page on failed attempts
							Fixed CSS so there is no overflowing text/images. This was fixed with the addition of a scroll bar.

25/10/16	21:00	23:00	FINALLY GOT COOKIES WORKING! Unsure if what I did was the right way but will get clarification at lab tomorrow. 

26/10/16	12:00	14:00	Added in a logout feature. Basically just removes cookies on press of logout button. 
							Also began work on adding in comments and replies to posts. Think I may need to restructure how Ive stored posts so far. 

26/10/16	18:00	19:45	After great struggling. Got comments working FULLY!!!!!. Wrote some subroutines for converting zIDs to names and indexes which helped greatly. 		

27/10/16	14:00	16:00	Added in a make post button. Was quite difficult how to make a directory and write to that directory in perl. Lots of fiddling around
